# Sudoku
This program coded in python solves any sudoku using a backtracking algorithm. It also has a graphic interface that allows the user to play the game.

# What I Learned
1. The use of graphic interfaces in pyhtom using pygame library.
2. Understan how recursive algorithms using backtracking work. 
3. How object orientated programming work in general terms, but specially in python.
